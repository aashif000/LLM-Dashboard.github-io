This is a Dashboard project. It is built with TypeScript, React, and Jest for testing. The project provides an interface for interacting with large language models (LLMs).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- TypeScript (for type safety)
- Jest (for testing)

## Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/aashif000/llm_dashboard.github.io
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

 ``` bash
cd llm_dashboard
npm install
 ```

### 3. Environment Setup
Make sure you have the correct environment configurations, such as API keys or any other environment-specific variables. You can add environment variables in a .env file.

### 4. Run the Development Server
To start the development server, run:

 ```bash
npm run dev
 ```
This will start the server, and the application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Testing
### 1. Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:

 ```bash 
npm test
 ```
This will trigger Jest to run the test suites and output the results.

### 2. Testing in Development Mode
For continuous testing, you can run Jest in watch mode:

 ```bash
npm run test:watch
 ```
This will watch for file changes and automatically rerun the tests.
